Nice article!

Ever since Tokopedia's user credentials got acquired by actor, I use password manager[^1], store a bit longer password than I usually use, and make them all different with a formatting that is different by many factors. I also use 2FA app[^2] if possible.

The next step I use is quitting Google step-by-step. First mail provider, then I try to find other alternatives
